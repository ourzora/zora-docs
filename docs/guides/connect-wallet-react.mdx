##### Connecting a user's wallet in React

---

The ZORA Development Kit (ZDK) requires a connection to a node to both read from the blockchain and submit transactions.
By having a user connect their wallet to your application, you can communicate to a node through their wallet.

:::note

If your application _only_ needs to read data from the blockchain, we recommend using the [ZORA indexer](../developer-tools/indexer/introduction) which doesn't require a connection to a node.

:::

In order to submit a transaction, you must provide an [ethers signer](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/providers/#Signer).
The ZORA team typically uses [web3-react](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/web3-react) or [web3modal](https://github.com/web3modal/web3modal) to connect a user's wallet.
Once you set up these libraries, you can then pass in the wallet connection into the ZDK.

```typescript
import { useWeb3React } from '@web3-react/core'

function MyComponent() {
  const { library, chainId } = useWeb3React()
  // library is a ethers provider/signer instance
  // Ethereum Mainnet (1) for the chainId

  const auctionHouse = useMemo(() => {
    if (library && chainId) {
      return new AuctionHouse(library.getSigner(), chainId)
    }
  }, [library, chainId])
  return auctionHouse ? (
    <ManageAuction auctionHouse={auctionHouse} />
  ) : (
    <div>Please connect wallet</div>
  )
}
```

#### Hosted URLs

If you want to allow easy bidding and listing of NFTs, ZORA supports hosted urls where the user can interact with the [ZORA.co](https://zora.co/)
interface without you needing to setup any wallet login.

```typescript
https://zora.co/collections/{TOKEN_ADDRESS}/{TOKEN_ID}/auction/list
// Lists the given token for an auction house auction

https://zora.co/collections/{TOKEN_ADDRESS}/{TOKEN_ID}/auction/bid
// Allows the user to bid on the active auction for the given token
```
