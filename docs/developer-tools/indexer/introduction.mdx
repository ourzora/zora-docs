##### Quick retrieval of NFT and ZORA related data

---

ZORA maintains its own indexer that serves a GraphQL API and provides information about the ZORA protocol and
the broader NFT ecosystem.

<!-- **[Indexer Diagram goes here]** -->

The Indexer watches the blockchain and regularly fetches NFT metadata data which makes it easy to query NFTs by their
metadata properties. The Indexer currently watches the `Ethereum Mainnet` and the `Rinkeby Testnest` but will be extended to include other EVM networks in the future.

:::note

You can begin making queries in ZORA's hosted GraphQL [playground](https://ourZORA.github.io/indexer-playground/).

:::

## Querying the Indexer

Make a `POST` request to the indexer url to query against the Indexer's GraphQL API.

```bash
# Ethereum Mainnet
https://indexer-prod-mainnet.ZORA.co/v1/graphql
```

If you are making an unauthenticated request, make sure to include `X-Hasura-Role: anonymous` in the header of the request.

### Fetching any NFT

You can directly view ERC-721 NFTs by querying the `Token` table. The example query below fetches the first 100 Blitmap `tokenIds` .
Querying the `TokenContract` table will return all the currently supported NFT contract addresses.

```graphql
{
  Token(
    where: { address: { _eq: "0x8d04a8c79cEB0889Bdd12acdF3Fa9D207eD3Ff63" } }
    order_by: { tokenId: asc }
    limit: 100
  ) {
    tokenId
    address
    minter
    owner
    metadata {
      json
    }
  }
}
```

### Fetching a zNFT

You can use the `Media` table to fetch information on ZORA NFTs (zNFTs). The example query below fetches the last 100 NFTs minted
out of the ZORA Media contract.

```graphql
{
  Media(order_by: { tokenId: desc }, limit: 100) {
    tokenId
    creator
    creatorBidShare
    owner
    contentURI
    metadataURI
    contentHash
    metadataHash
    metadata {
      json
    }
  }
}
```

### Fetching a ZORA Auction

You can query for a ZORA Auction by using the `Auction` table. The example query below fetches the auctions that have had
their reserve price met, but have not been finalized (listed in order of `auctionId`).

```graphql
{
  Auction(
    where: { lastBidder: { _is_null: false }, _not: { endedEvent: {} } }
    order_by: { auctionId: desc }
    limit: 10
  ) {
    tokenContract
    tokenId
    tokenOwner
    auctionCurrency
    reservePrice
    curator
    curatorFee
    approved
    expiresAt
    winner
    lastBidder
    lastBidAmount
  }
}
```

## Adding a New Contract to the Indexer

Currently NFT contracts are being manually added to the ZORA indexer. If you would like to
have a contract indexed for `Ethereum Mainnet` or `Rinkeby Testnet` fill out this [typeform](https://ourzora.typeform.com/to/cyLgJzHg).
