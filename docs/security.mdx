- Publishing sensitive information discovered during security testing is prohibited.
- Only submit one vulnerability per report.
- Vulnerabilities that Zora is aware of will not be rewarded.
- Please provide thorough reports with clear steps that can be replicated. If the report lacks sufficient detail to reproduce the issue, it may not be accepted.
- When duplicates occur, we will only accept the first report that was received, as long as it fulfills our submission criteria and can be fully reproduced.



### Disclosure Policy

To ensure responsible handling of vulnerability disclosures, it is crucial to keep all discussions of such vulnerabilities (even those that have already been resolved) within the program and not disclose them externally within 90 days of remediation or without Zora's express approval. Failure to comply with the Disclosure Policy will result in forfeiture of any eligible reward. Be confident that you are adhering to this policy and contributing to the safety and integrity of the program.
