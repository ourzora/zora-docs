# Introduction

The ZORA API makes it easy to retrieve NFT metadata, monitor on-chain events, and analyze on-chain sales activity.

:::note

✨ **You can test out the API without needing a key. It’s free to use right now** ✨

API Endpoint: https://api.zora.co/graphql

[SDK](./zdk): A development kit to use the API without needing to know GraphQL

[NFT Hooks](../developer-tools/nft-hooks/intro): A tool that makes NFT data retrieval even easier than the ZDK

:::

## Key Features

- Sales info from on-chain marketplaces (ZORA, OpenSea, LooksRare, Foundation, and more.)
- Data on every Ethereum NFT contract (Transfers, Mints, etc.)
- Media is encoded to provide assets at different sizes
- Automatically syncs newly deployed NFT contracts
- Fill orders made on OpenSea (Seaport)
- Text-based search for discoverability
- And much more

## Supported Networks

The API is expanding to more networks and currently supports:

| Network         | ChainId | Status         |
| --------------- | ------- | -------------- |
| ETH Mainnet     | 1       | Entire History |
| Goerli          | 5       | Tip of Chain   |
| ZORA            | 7777777 | Entire History |
| ZORA Goerli     | 999     | Entire History |
| Base            | 8453    | Entire History |
| Base Goerli     | 84531   | Entire History |
| Optimism        | 10      | Entire History |

## Getting Started

If you are unfamiliar with GraphQL, we recommend that you [check out this resource](https://www.howtographql.com/basics/0-introduction/).
In addition, here are a few considerations before using the API.

- The [ZDK](./zdk) and [NFT Hooks](../developer-tools/nft-hooks/intro) allow anyone to build top on of the API without needing to know GraphQL.
- Currently supports any `ERC-721` NFTs
- Maximum page size limit is `500` for regular queries and `50` for text-based searches
- Check out the guides section to begin building

## Authentication

Anyone can use the API **without an API key** as long as the application is making **less than 120 requests per minute.**

| **Needs**                            | **API Key Requirements** |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Less than 120 requests per minute    | **No Key Needed**        |
| Greater than 120 requests per minute | Key Needed               |

You can get an API key [here](https://keys.api.zora.co/) if your needs require **greater than 120 requests per minute.**
To access the API with a key, add a header in your requests with the key `X-API-KEY` .

```
headers={"X-API-KEY": <your_api_key>}
```
