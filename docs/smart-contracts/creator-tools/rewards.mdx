## Introduction

At Zora, we are passionate about providing the best experience to create and earn onchain.
**Protocol Rewards** is a split of our the Zora mint fee allowing:

- Creators to monetize their work
- Developers to earn from NFT mints and creations they facilitate

## Address

Rewards v1.1 is deployed at the same address on all networks.

**Mint Referral**: The platform that referred a specific mint of an NFT  
**Create Referral**: The platform that referred the creator to deploy the NFT collection 
**First Minter**: The first collector to mint an NFT, defaults to the NFT creator if a normal NFT  

## How It Works: Creator

1. Creator selects the **"Free + Rewards"** pricing option when creating their 721 or 1155 NFT
2. Creator specifies a wallet address eligible to claim their rewards
3. Creator opens up their edition for minting -- **that's it!**

The creator's total ETH generated from rewards is aggregated into an [escrow contract](https://github.com/ourzora/protocol-rewards/blob/main/src/ProtocolRewards.sol) and can be withdrawn at any time.

## How It Works: Developer

### Create Referral Reward

The create referral reward is paid out to the developer or platform that referred the creator to deploy their NFT collection using Zora's contracts.

#### Creating an ERC-1155 Token with Rewards

The `createReferral` address is specified upon token creation.

```
function setupNewTokenWithCreateReferral(
    string calldata newURI,
    uint256 maxSupply,
    address createReferral
) public
```

### Mint Referral Reward

The mint referral reward is paid out to the party that referred the collector to mint an NFT.

#### ERC-1155 Minting with Rewards

```
function mintWithRewards(
    IMinter1155 minter,
    uint256 tokenId,
    uint256 quantity,
    bytes calldata minterArguments,
    address mintReferral
)
```

## Withdrawing Rewards
Rewards must be withdrawn from the escrow contract, which the address can be found [here](https://github.com/ourzora/protocol-rewards/tree/main/addresses).
```
function withdraw(address to, uint256 amount)
```

Withdraw for another address directly.
```
function withdrawFor(address to, uint256 amount) 
```

```
function withdrawWithSig(
    address from, 
    address to
    uint256 amount, 
    uint256 deadline, 
    uint8 v, 
    bytes32 
    r, 
    bytes32 s
)
```
