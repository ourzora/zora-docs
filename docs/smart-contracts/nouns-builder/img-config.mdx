##### Configuring the NFTs Images
---

Every time an auction is started a new NFT image is randomly generated.
These properties are first set when the DAO is created by providing a folder of artwork layers.

Note, that the properties for the DAO NFTs are stored in a single folder on IPFS and then randomly generated using the image properties.

### Image Requirments
- PNG and SVG are the only supported file types
- 600px x 600px minimum for PNGs and 32px minimum for SVGs
- Images must be square

### Properties vs Items
- `Properties:` Categories of different traits for the DAO NFTs 
- `Items:` Distinct images that make up a property

<img class="guide-photos" src={builderProperties} alt="builder-proterties"/>

### Seed Generation
The seed is used to create a random combination of properties for the DAO NFTs.
It is generated in the [Metadata Render Contract](https://github.com/ourzora/nouns-protocol/blob/main/src/token/metadata/MetadataRenderer.sol#L279) by calling `_generateSeed` with the current tokenId and salting the hash with block data.

```
function _generateSeed(uint256 _tokenId) private view returns (uint256) {
    return uint256(keccak256(abi.encode(_tokenId, blockhash(block.number), block.coinbase, block.timestamp)));
}
```

### Adding Properties
Once the properties have been uploaded to IPFS they then need to be added to the metadata render by calling `addProperties`.
```
/// @notice Adds properties and/or items to be pseudo-randomly chosen from during token minting
/// @param _names The names of the properties to add
/// @param _items The items to add to each property
/// @param _ipfsGroup The IPFS base URI and extension
function addProperties(
    string[] calldata _names,
    ItemParam[] calldata _items,
    IPFSGroup calldata _ipfsGroup
) external onlyOwner
```
