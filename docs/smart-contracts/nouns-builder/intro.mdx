# Introduction

##### Build your own DAO

---

Nouns builder allows anyone to easily deploy a DAO in minutes.
Inspired by [NounsDAO](https://nouns.center/intro), Nouns builder uses a factory contract called the Manager to create custom Nouns-styled DAOs.

#### Why Nouns styled DAOs are interesting

- `Distribution Mechanism:` Creating an NFT at a consistent interval allows the community to form at a healthy rate rather than distributing governance via an airdrop.
- `Composable and Upgradable:` All contracts are individually upgradable meaning the DAO is not a static thing, but rather something that is meant to evolve over time.
- `Perpetual Funding:` The DAO creates sustainable funding by consistently issuing new NFTs over time.

## Core Contracts

Definitions for the key contracts that make up Builder.

- `Manager:` In charge of deploying custom DAOs

DAO Components:

- `Token:` ERC-721 NFT contract which has its minting controlled by the Auction contract
- `Metadata Renderer:` On-chain metadata renderer for the NFTs
- `Auction:` Mints new NFTs and auctions them off
- `Treasury:` Stores DAO funds and executes transactions based on governance
- `Governance:` Holds logic for creating and voting on proposals

## Custom Settings

The important settings that can be configured when first creating a DAO and later updated by Governance.

- `DAO Metadata`: Name, Description, Image, [Website]
- `Auction Duration:` How often a new NFT is created and put up for auction
- `Auction Reserve Price:` Min bid required to start an auction
- `Proposal Threshold:` Min [BPS](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basispoint.asp) of total votes (NFTs) needed to put a proposal to a vote.
  For example, if the Proposal Threshold is set to 100 BPS and there are 500 total NFTs minted then 5 NFTs need to approve the proposal for it to be put to a vote.
- `Quorum Threshold:` Min BPS of total **For** votes (NFTs) required for a proposal to pass
- `Veto Power:` Optional choice for founders to be able to veto proposals
- `NFT Image Properties:` Image components used for creating the NFTs
- `Founders and Allocations:` Set multiple founders with different allocations

Note, veto power is encouraged due to the small number of votes (NFTs) at the beginning of a DAO.
The veto can later before removed by the founders once the NFTs have become sufficiently decentralized.
