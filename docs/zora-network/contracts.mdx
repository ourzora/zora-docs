# Deploying Contracts

---

Deploying contracts can be done with familiar EVM tools like [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/). 
Make sure to configure these tools with the correct chain ID and RPC URL to deploy smart contracts to Zora Network Sepolia and Zora Network Mainnet. See the [Network Details](/docs/zora-network/network) section for more information.

## Foundry

### Setup

See the [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) documentation to initialize your project with Foundry.

### Deploying
To deploy smart contracts to Zora Network with Foundry, remember to use the --rpc-url and --chain-id flags with the correct values for the Zora network you are deploying to. For example, to deploy to Zora Sepolia:

```bash
forge create src/MyContract.sol:MyContract --chain-id 999999999 --rpc-url https://sepolia.rpc.zora.energy/ --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY 
```

You can use the same flags for more complicated deploy commands, such as with constructor arguments or a deploy script.

### Verifying
To deploy and verify your contract in one command, use Foundry's verification flags configured with Blockscout and Zora Network's Blockscout API:

```bash
forge create src/MyContract.sol:MyContract --chain-id 999999999 --rpc-url https://sepolia.rpc.zora.energy/ --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --verify --verifier blockscout --verifier-url https://sepolia.explorer.zora.energy/api\?
```

You can also verify a pre-existing contract with the `forge verify-contract` command using the same flags (`--verifier` and `--verifier-url`).

Note: Zora uses Blockscout which requires appending `\?` to the end of the API url like in the example above. More details [here](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/5160).

Alternatively, use Standard JSON Input to verify a pre-existing contract by appending the `--show-standard-json-input` option to `forge verify-contract`, creating a JSON file from the output and uploading that file to the Blockscout UI.


## Hardhat

### Setup
Refer to Hardhat's [Quick Start](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#quick-start) guide to install Hardhat and initialize your project. 
To configure your project, add the Zora Network information in `hardhat.config.js`:

```js
import { HardhatUserConfig } from 'hardhat/config';
import '@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox';

require('dotenv').config();

const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  solidity: {
    version: '0.8.17',
  },
  networks: {
    // for testnet
    'zora-sepolia': {
      url: 'https://sepolia.rpc.zora.energy/',
      accounts: [process.env.WALLET_KEY as string],
    },
    // for mainnet
    'zora-mainnet': {
      url: 'https://rpc.zora.energy/',
      accounts: [process.env.WALLET_KEY as string],
    },
  },
  defaultNetwork: 'hardhat',
};

export default config;
```

### Deploying
After you've configured your Hardhat project to work with Zora Network, you can compile, test, and deploy your contracts.
#### Compiling your contracts
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```
#### Testing contracts
```bash
npx hardhat test
```
#### Deploying your contracts
For Zora Mainnet:
```bash
npx hardhat run --network zora-mainnet scripts/deploy.js
```
For Zora Sepolia Testnet:
```bash
npx hardhat run --network zora-sepolia scripts/deploy.js
```

### Verifying
Zora Network uses Blockscout for chain exploration and contract verification. See Blockscout's [Hardhat plugin guide](https://docs.blockscout.com/for-users/verifying-a-smart-contract/hardhat-verification-plugin) to verify contracts with Hardhat and Blockscout.
